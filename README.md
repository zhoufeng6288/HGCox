# HGCox
The repository implements the mean-field approximation algorithm for the heterogeneous multi-task Gaussian Cox processes in the paper "Heterogeneous Multi-Task Gaussian Cox Processes".

We recommend to read the tutorial to get familiar with this module. It introduces the key points in the model and illustrates how to perfrom simulation and inference.

For any further details, please refer to the paper. 

# Note
In order to draw a 2-dimensional map of Vancouver, you need to install the geopandas package first which is available at https://pypi.org/project/geopandas/.
